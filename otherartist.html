                <article >
                    <p>Fernando Amorsolo was a protraitist and painter of rural Philippine Landscapes. Nicknamed "the Grand Old 
                        Man of Philippine Art", he was the first-ever to be recognized as a National Artist of the Philippines. He 
                        was recognized as such for his "pioneering use of impressionistic technique" as well as his skill in the use of lighting 
                        and backlighting in his paintings, significant not only in the development of Philippine art but also in the formation 
                        of Filipino notions of self and identity.
